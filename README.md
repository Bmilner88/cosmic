# Basic General Ideas:
Initial version could be a simple “flappy-bird” type runner where you are trying to get as far as possible. Rogue-like in a sense

-Multiple game modes (i.e. “Story” mode or main run, randomized run, endless, etc.)

-Multiplayer modes (same as SF64 battle, or score battles)

-Randomly generated runs (similar to FTL)

-Different Graphics modes (main high detail textures, N64 mode, SNES mode)
OR
Simple graphics (bright colors, smooth textures, Animal Crossing/Parkitect)

-Unique bosses for each level

-Possible random bosses for random runs

-Different ship gun types

-Different ship bomb types

-Unique ship customization and upgrades (speed, shield generation)

-VR - Would probably need to be it’s own mode, maybe only Multiplayer
